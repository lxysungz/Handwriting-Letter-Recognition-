# Handwriting-Letter-Recognition-
In this notebook, we use the EMNIST data that is in mnist format The main task is to classify handwritten letters into 26 different letters. The major parts of the code:
	•Extract training data, prepare input data for training model
	•Convert jpg file to mnist format
 	•5 layer neural network with L2 regularization, visulize the training using tensor board
 	•Restore the checkpoints to recoginze handwritten letters jpg files
